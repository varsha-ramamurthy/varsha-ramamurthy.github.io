Data Journalism and D3 Homework

## Methods Used

- The index.html page and the data.csv files were provided to complete the homework

- Using the data.csv file, app.js was filled with code utilizing D3 and javascript to create a scatter plot showing the correlation between healthcare access and poverty in all 50 states

- The scatter plot generated from the data shows an upward trend, therefore showing a directly proportional relationship between the poverty rates and lack of healthcare in a state.

- Using this info, the lorem ipsum text on the index.html file was adjusted accordingly to describe the visualization of the data.csv file via scatter plot using D3
